## üîß Configuration

### API Setup

This application uses a custom API that I've developed to communicate with Weather API. The API code is available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Crisxzu/weather-api). You can:

- Deploy your own instance of the API using your Weather API key
- Use the default API endpoint that comes with the APK release (which uses my hosted instance)

### Debug Mode

The application includes a debug mode that can be activated through the `.env` file:

- When `DEBUG_MODE = 0` (default): The app connects to the actual API
- When `DEBUG_MODE = 1`: The app uses test data from `assets/json/weather_data.json`

This is useful for development and testing without consuming API requests.

### Environment Variables

The app uses the `envied` package to securely manage environment variables. After creating your `.env` file, you need to generate the configuration file:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

Example `.env` file:
```
WEATHER_API_KEY = your_weather_api_key
WEATHER_API_LINK = your_api_url
BASE_ICON_URL = "https://cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64"
PORTFOLIO_LINK = "https://dazu.fr"
DEBUG_MODE = 0
```
